# InferSent

*InferSent* is a *sentence embeddings* method that provides semantic sentence representations. It is trained on natural language inference data and generalizes well to many different tasks.

We provide our pre-trained sentence encoder for reproducing the results from [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364). See also [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) for automatic evaluation of the quality of sentence embeddings.
