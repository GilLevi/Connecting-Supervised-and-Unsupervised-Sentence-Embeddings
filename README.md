# Connecting Supervised and Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Connecting Supervised and Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings" presented at the 3rd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (rep4NLP) held in conjuction with ACL 2018. Our work is based on the [InferSent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364) (Conneau et al., 2017). 

While (Conneau et al., 2017) uses only a supervised loss, we add to their framework additional unsupervised losses that act as regularization terms. We evaluate our results using [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) and show improved results on various downstream tasks.
