# Connecting Supervised and Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Connecting Supervised and Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings" presented at the 3rd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (rep4NLP) held in conjuction with ACL 2018. Our work is based on the [InferSent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364) paper by Conneau et al. 

# InferSent

*InferSent* is a *sentence embeddings* method that provides semantic sentence representations. It is trained on natural language inference data and generalizes well to many different tasks.

We provide our pre-trained sentence encoder for reproducing the results from [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364). See also [SentEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) for automatic evaluation of the quality of sentence embeddings.
